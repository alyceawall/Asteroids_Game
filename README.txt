# Asteroids

Welcome to our Atari Asteroids Simulation Experience. 

If you are part of the INSPECTORS sent by Earth 1.0 Command to perform a quality check on our Station, please proceed down this message, below our asteroid art, to find a message from the Commander specifically for you. But, if you have the time, we encourage you to read the instructions we give incoming pilots as well! (Our Human Resource department put a lot of effort into it).

If you are a new PILOT, please read the following important message from Commander Lerner to learn what to expect on your first mission as an Atari Conductor Expert (A.C.E)

WELCOME STATEMENT
Congratulations on completing your basic pilot training, and becoming an A.C.E! We hope you've enjoyed your journey to get to the Terran Interglactic Station (T.I.S). Due to the gravitational differences from the ATARAI Planet Cluster and your home planet System, Sol, the aircrafts you'll be piloting here have a modified control system than what you are used to. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the following before embarking on your adventure:
------------------------
-UP_ARROW -> Activate THRUST to change ship's moving trajectory towards where your ship is facing. Increases speed.
-DOWN_ARROW -> Reverse THRUST to slow down the aircraft. Useful to avoid incoming asteroids.
-LEFT_ARROW -> STEER the ship to rotate towards the LEFT. Does not change movement direction unless you activate THRUST.
-RIGHT_ARROW -> STEER the ship to rotate towards the RIGHT. Does not change movement direction unless you activate THRUST.
-SPACE_BAR -> SHOOT bullets in the direction your aircraft is currently facing.
-H_KEY -> Activate HYPERSPACE. Teleport your ship anywhere in the Asteroid Area. Useful for a quick getaway, but could end in disaster if you're unlucky enough to teleport into an asteroid
----------------------------

MISSION CRITICAL INFORMATION

___MOVEMENT:
Please be aware that the heavy gravity in the ATARI Planet Cluster is especially bad in the Asteroid Area. Therefore, your ship will not be able to mantain its speed, and will slow down as time goes on if THRUST is not engaged. Additionally, once all asteroids have been destroyed, the sudden shift in the space-matter will cause additional asteroids to appear. They will be larger in number, and faster. Don't worry, with your training and courage you will be able to handle them perfectly. Probably.

___POINTS:
Every asteroid you kill will yield 500 points to your A.C.E Balance. Every time you gain an additonal 10000 points, Terran Command will provide you with one more Shield Charge to use in case of collision.

___LIVES:
An A.C.E SHIP comes with three Shield Charges. Upon collision with an asteroid, the charge will destroy the 'roid and hyperspace the ship to center of the Asteroid Area. For the next 1.2 seconds, your ship will phase through space-matter in such way that it will be immune to any collisions. Be careful not to be inside an asteroid when the protection wears off! 

___GAME OVER
Due to the A.C.E SHIP's engeneers' sense of humor, you'll see these Shield Charges labeled as "Lives" on your dashboard. Do not be concerned you do not die once you are out of "lives". We will automatically teleport you back to the T.I.S safe and sound. And Alive. We Promise <3.

---------------------------------------------------------
WOW! LOOK out the window of your space shuttle!! You can see two beautful asteroids floating by. They might look really cool up close, but they are a nightmare for humans trying to set roots in the ATARAI Planet Cluster. You're going to be changing lives during your time here! 

Good Luck, Ace!

____A MESSAGE TO OUR VALUED INSPECTORS
All of our systems abroad the Terran Intergalactic Sation work perfectly! Please feel free to ensure this by personally taking an ACE Ship to the Asteroid Area-- Commander Lerner has granted you express permission to any ship despite your lack of InterSpace Aircraft Licenses.

However, our system tests are currently acting up. They appear to run perfectly on some hardware, and yield some fails on different hardware. If your testing devices show strange fails, specifically on the warp and heavy coordinate based tests, the T.I.S staff implores you to take a peek at the testing code itself to assure yourself that the logic there is sound. The getHeight and width dimensions appear to be on a hardware-by-hardware basis on what value they want to give. We hope Earth 1.0's Command Station will understand, as these hardware conditions are out of our staff's hands.

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your time abroad the Terran Intergalactic Station
